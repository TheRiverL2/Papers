# Overview
This is the GreenPaper of River L2 network.

In this Paper We are talk about the river aim for and answer some question about the river.
## What's River?

River is a layer-2 network protocol for the Algorand blockchain. It is a stream based network.

## Why River?
The blockchain we have now:
- need to wait for the block to be confirmed.

The River aim for:
- real-time stream.

## How River works?
The River will be assembled with nodes. The data on this network is stream.

People can host River node or use River node for their stream. And the River will have crypto currency for the stream.

River is based on Algorand blockchain. And the crypto currency will be an asset on Algorand blockchain. The hoster will get the crypto currency for the stream. The user will pay the crypto currency for the stream.

## Why River use Algorand?
Algorand is a blockchain with high TPS and low cost. We can use Algorand to build the accounting system for the River.
## What's the difference between River and other blockchain?
### Real time
The normal blockchain need to wait the block to be confirmed to get new data. But the River don't so the data will be real time.

### Stream
The normal blockchain is using transaction to store data, and read by others. But the River is using stream to transfer data.

## Q&A
### If River not need to wait for the block to be confirmed, how to prevent the data been hacked?

We plan to sample the data and validate the data. Use multiple node to prevent the cheat.
